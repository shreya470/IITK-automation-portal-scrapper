# IITK-automation-portal-scrapper
This repository contains code to scrap the faculty data and IITK student data done using Beautifulsoup  and requests. The faculty data scrapper is just directly available on the automation portal HTML but the student search scrapper is bit complicated and hope you find it helpful.
